Some of the following could use some work
- Need to learn how to configure Alpha through seperate file 
- Commenting is messed up with commenting style
- Set up nvim-tree such that it does not open every time a new file is opened
- Automatic indenting is not working as desired for some file types (ex: .css)
- Optimize keybinds for various plugins
